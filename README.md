# **Intersection of Police Homicides in the US**
This report explores the relationship between race, income, and police homicides in the United States.

## **Background**
The US has a long history of police practices that disproportionately impact minority communities. Despite progress made since the Civil Rights Act, racial income disparities and inequalities have only slightly diminished. Each year, hundreds of individuals are killed by police, with a disproportionate number coming from America’s poorest neighborhoods that tend to have the highest number of non-white residents. To address these issues, it is crucial to understand community demographics and how they relate to police-related deaths.

## **Data Collection**
The Guardian's The Counted series provided the basis for this report's analysis. The data set includes information on more than 400 individuals killed by police in 2015, including county and census tract demographics from the 2015 US Census for each incident.

## **Analysis**
The report analyzes the relationship between individuals’ race/ethnicity and their community’s tract median household income in the context of community demographics. The goal of this analysis is to identify potential links between racial bias in police homicides and community-level economic status.
